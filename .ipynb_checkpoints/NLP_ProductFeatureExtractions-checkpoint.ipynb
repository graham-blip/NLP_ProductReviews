    "The task is split into three sub tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identification of keyphrases that describe product features (e.g., picture quality and battery life for digital cameras).\n",
    "2. Detection of polarity in the sentences that discuss each of the product features.\n",
    "3. Summarisation of the features and sentiments associated with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In online reviews the same feature and product attribute can be described in many different ways for example \"cable\" and \"wire\" are largely considered synonymous. Often even if there is a technical difference, in the context on reviews the author may not distinguish between such differences and it can be problematic to be too specific with being to techincally precise in classifying the different prduct features being reffered to. As such similar attributes need to be combined to enable for a better and more robust identification of the keyphrase attribute being reviewed. However, simply clubbing together synonyms is not sufficient for example \"appearance\" and \"design\" are not synonymous but can refer to the same feature - the design.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the sentiment is equally challenging, here there can be multiple ways to express the sentiment for example \"awful\" and \"not so good\" are both negative reviews but expressed in different ways. Additionally, the negation here provides and extra layer of comlexity. As such treating the reviews as a simple bag of words without taking into account the context of each word will miss such negation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the model needs to be trained in a general enough way to deal with three seperate data sets (this was a choice to keep the three seperate to illustrate how the full pipline can deal with different data-sets) and avoid overfitting a particular triaining data set with manual imputs when training it."

It then finds the optimal hyper-plane, which is then able to calssify new reviews. The SVM Classifier is expected to perform similarly to Logistic Regression unless there is a suspect of many outliers in the data set (Salazar 2012). In this case there was no evidence to suggest that we have significant outliers (again we are dealing with narrow reviews of specific products) as such this model was not expected to outperform Logisitc Regression.  \n",

Due to the additional randomness in the model the random forest is expected to be a more robust model and provide a better result on the test data.

    "## Concluding Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "This input data sets dealt with a wide variety of different products. While the pipline could have been built on all 17 different product types this would be unfeasable in terms of time the code would run. As such the pipline was built with a focus around a smaller subset of prouducts and as such there was a balance to achieve with providing a generalised and robust pipeline that will also work on different product types but staying within the remit of an accurate feature extraction and sentiment analysis. Ultimately, there will be features that where skipped over and others which could have been clubbed together further.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore in terms of evaluating the results the very nature of this project being natural langugage processing where things can be a little subjective. A human reading a review may not necessarily attribute the review as a negative review when the scentence taken on it's own would be considered a negative review. In addition while the sentiment models can be evaluated these targets are from manual labels where errors and bias can mean that these targets are incorrect or even missing. Lastly, with feature extraction to fully evaluate the performance of this would require manually reading all the reviews and extracting the feature and then comparing this list with the extracted list of features. As such a full evaluation beyond what was performed in this project is not only beyond the scope of this project but also something which is subjective and it would be difficult to agree on a so called \"*ground truth*. Overall, the results where not too far fetched and the groupings of features upon manual inspection does appear to have a clear category.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the use of WordNet significantly, slows down this code and there are other solutions that future work can be considered for example using high adjective count and the max opionion score algorithms are among the more efficient algorithms that could have been implemented (Seltzer, 2011). The choice of the use of WordNet was an attempt to replicate the Methods used by Hu and Liu in the origional research paper (Hu and Liu, 2004)."
